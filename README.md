## About Me 
Hi, I'm Neha Kumari, a passionate blockchain developer with a mission to democratize finance through decentralized technologies. With learning experience in Stellar, smart contracts, and full-stack development, I created AstroFi to empower the scientific community with secure, transparent, and accessible financial tools. Through this project, I  aim to deliver a robust solution for the space community and research programs to get easily funded and the investors can even be rewarded with `MissionNFT` badge to showcase their contributions -- promoting win-win situation for both parties involved.

## What is AstroFi?
AstroFi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Stellar blockchain, designed to provide fast, low-cost, and secure financial services. By leveraging Stellar‚Äôs robust network and custom smart contracts (via Soroban), AstroFi enables users to lend, stake, and transfer assets globally with minimal fees.

## ## FRONTEND (Next.js) Flow

1. **User lands** ‚Üí
    
    Fetch & display **missions/projects** dynamically (title, desc, goal fund, associated orgs, uploadables).
    
2. **Connect Wallet**

    - Via Freighter extension (`WalletProvider` already setup ‚úÖ).
3. **User clicks Fund** on any Mission ‚Üí
    - Input: amount to donate (in XLM).
4. **On Payment Proceed**:
    - Initiate `fund_program()` Smart Contract function call using Stellar SDK + Soroban SDK.
    - Once payment is confirmed:
        - Call `mintNft()` Smart Contract function to mint **Mission NFT** (metadata = wallet address + missionID + contribution).
5. **Show NFT Rewards page** ‚Äî user's NFT minted records.

## üîπ SMART CONTRACTS on Soroban

-  Smart Contracts üìú
- `Contract Address: CDNYQW733S7TLMUOCB7NKMMAQAT42FCC6ZS3JMVYZJTR54M44OFSR3ZR `

| Contract | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **MissionFundContract** | Manages program funding (`fund_program()`, `calc_remaining_fund()`) |
| **MissionNftContract** | Handles reward NFT minting (`mintNft()`) |

# **AstroFi Smart Contracts (Soroban)**

1. **FundMission Contract**
    - Accept funding deposits
    - call nftMint() contract and assign `Mission {Title} Nft` reward to users on complete funding
    - track the remaining project funding `Remaining`:  to calculate how much funding for the project is still needed after a contributor donates.
    - `let remaining_fund = mission.amount - funding_amount`
    
    
2. **NFTMint Contract**
    - Mint NFT badges when user donates
    - Link NFT to Mission ID & User Address
    - nft metadata structure :
    
    `{
    "description": Mission Description,
    "image": `MissionImg` or` [NFT Mission Image](https://www.freepik.com/free-ai-image/international-day-education-futuristic-style_94953586.htm#fromView=search&page=1&position=21&uuid=78ee3014-9b0b-47b1-802c-2405ffc5775d&query=astronomy+research)`,
    "name": MissionTitle,
    "attributes": [contributor's wallet address, MissionID ]
    }`
