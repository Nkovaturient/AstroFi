## About Me 
Hi, I'm Neha Kumari, a passionate blockchain developer with a mission to democratize finance through decentralized technologies. With learning experience in Stellar, smart contracts, and full-stack development, I created AstroFi to empower the scientific community with secure, transparent, and accessible financial tools. Through this project, I  aim to deliver a robust solution for the space community and research programs to get easily funded and the investors can even be rewarded with `MissionNFT` badge to showcase their contributions -- promoting win-win situation for both parties involved.

## What is AstroFi?
