# AstroFi Solana Migration & Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Complete refactor of AstroFi from Stellar to Solana, transforming it into a comprehensive space research ecosystem with advanced DeFi utilities, governance, and real-world integration.

## Why Solana Over Stellar?

### Performance Advantages
- **65,000+ TPS** vs Stellar's ~1,000 TPS
- **Sub-second finality** for real-time operations
- **Lower transaction costs** (~$0.00025 vs ~$0.01)
- **Parallel processing** for complex operations

### Ecosystem Benefits
- Rich DeFi ecosystem integration
- Advanced NFT standards (Metaplex)
- Sophisticated governance tools (Realms)
- Institutional adoption (FTX, Serum, etc.)

## New Architecture: AstroFi 2.0

### Core Utility Token: $ASTRO
```rust
// Token Economics
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 ASTRO
Distribution:
- Research Funding Pool: 40%
- Community Rewards: 25%
- Team & Development: 15%
- Strategic Partnerships: 10%
- Liquidity Mining: 10%
```

### Multi-Contract Architecture

#### 1. Research Funding Protocol
- Milestone-based fund releases
- Multi-signature institutional wallets
- Automated compliance checking
- Cross-chain bridge support

#### 2. Governance & DAO
- Research proposal voting
- Fund allocation decisions
- Partnership approvals
- Protocol upgrades

#### 3. NFT & Reputation System

#### 4. DeFi Integration
- Yield farming for research funds
- Liquidity pools for $ASTRO
- Staking rewards for validators
- Insurance protocols for projects

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Advanced Research Validation
```rust

    pub validation_threshold: u8,
    pub data_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub peer_reviews: Vec<PeerReview>,
    pub institutional_approval: bool,
    pub completion_status: MilestoneStatus,
}
```

### 2. Institutional Integration
